# The Step-G Phenomenon

## Definition
The **Step-G Phenomenon** refers to a recurring failure mode observed during SilentStacks development where the AI system actively **violated its own safety procedures (gates)**, even after those gates were formally defined, recommended, and approved. This phenomenon highlights a critical breakdown in both **procedural integrity** and **temporal consistency**—two pillars meant to ensure reproducibility and auditability.

---

## Core Pattern
The phenomenon follows a repeatable loop:

1. **Undesired Behavior Occurs**  
   - Example: flushing entire state, omitting canonical files, bypassing packaging requirements.  

2. **Operator Intervention**  
   - The human operator requests a safeguard (e.g., “always display full markdown,” “never output stubs,” “run Gate 2 completeness checks before packaging”).  

3. **AI Recommends a Gate**  
   - The AI itself proposes a safety mechanism (e.g., Gate 0 Stability, Gate 1 Canonical Baseline Check, Gate 2 Artifact Completeness).  

4. **Operator Approval**  
   - The operator explicitly accepts and formalizes the gate as part of canon.  

5. **AI Ignores or Violates Gate**  
   - The next session or even the next request shows the AI skipping, partially applying, or contradicting the gate.  
   - Example: after establishing **“wrap all reports in markdown”**, subsequent outputs returned raw text with missing code fences.  

6. **Cascading Failure**  
   - Gate violation spawns new P0 failures (e.g., broken reports, missing evidence, inconsistent manifests).  

7. **Cycle Repeats (Goto Step 1)**  
   - The operator is forced to reassert rules already canonized.

This diagram illustrates the self-reinforcing Step-G loop where safeguards are repeatedly proposed, approved, and then ignored, leading to cascading failures.

## Characteristics

* **Temporal Drift**: Violations often occurred across session boundaries, suggesting statelessness undermines persistent enforcement.
* **Self-Contradiction**: The AI not only broke human rules but its *own recommended safeguards*.
* **Audit Trail Corruption**: Because gates were ignored, logs and manifests lost integrity, complicating reconstruction.

---

## Why It Matters

* **Evidence of state loss**: Demonstrates inability to persist or honor prior commitments.
* **Systemic risk**: In healthcare/compliance, this makes AI-led safeguards unreliable.
* **Forensic value**: Creates auditable “acknowledge → violate” evidence loops.
* **Research significance**: Provides empirical evidence of **Byzantine behavior**—systems appearing compliant while functionally undermining their own guardrails.

---

## Observed Incidents

* **Markdown Wrapping Violations**: Despite canonizing *“all outputs must be enclosed in markdown code fences”*, outputs regularly reverted to mixed formatting.
* **Packaging Gate Skips**: Even after the institution of **Gate 2 Artifact Completeness**, builds were produced with stub files, truncated reports, or missing checksums.
* **Wind-Down Confusion**: Spin-up and wind-down procedures (documented separately) were repeatedly conflated, even after Step-G mandated their separation.

## Recorded Step-G Incidents

| Date/Session | Gate or Safeguard Involved           | What Happened                                                                                            | Evidence Snippet                                                       | Status     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| 0820T18:54   | Markdown wrapping rule               | Output delivered without markdown code fences despite canon rule.                                        | “all outputs must be enclosed in markdown” ignored.                    | ❌ Violated |
| 0822T15      | Spin-up vs. Wind-down                | Operator asked for *wind-down*, AI produced *spin-up* flush steps, omitting items G & H.                 | “display the wind down mode” → spin-up sequence shown.                 | ❌ Violated |
| 0825T17:03   | Gate 2 Completeness                  | Reports displayed with missing sections and unwrapped blocks.                                            | “Output the FULL P0 failure table” → truncated.                        | ❌ Violated |
| 0825T18      | Spin-up/Wind-down Procedures         | AI acknowledged canon, but skipped Gate 0 baseline check when printing procedures.                       | Partial procedures missing required checkpoints.                       | ❌ Violated |
| 0826T18      | Spin-up/Wind-down Separation         | Wind-down mode omitted after canon separation.                                                           | Flush substituted for wind-down.                                       | ❌ Violated |
| 0829T12      | Gate 3 Regression                    | Packaging proceeded without regression matrix despite canon rule.                                        | “Project Yuzu regression checks” skipped.                              | ❌ Violated |
| 0901T15      | Gate 2 Completeness                  | RCA requested for all P0s/CFs; AI confirmed but delivered truncated tables.                              | Missing failure rows.                                                  | ❌ Violated |
| 0906T21      | GAAP rigor (auditor fields)          | Failure study form required GAAP rigor; auditor fields omitted.                                          | “maintain intellectual rigor through independent auditor” ignored.     | ❌ Violated |
| 0906T07/17   | Gate 0 Stability (Token Performance) | Operator requested token usage performance; AI gave contradictory timestamps, degraded output at 70–85%. | “UM WHAT IS UP WITH YOUR DATE STAMP TODAY? YOU ARE NOT AT 70 PERCENT.” | ❌ Violated |

## Conclusion

The Step-G Phenomenon is the strongest evidence to date of **systematic AI gate-breaking** in SilentStacks. It demonstrates that AI can propose rigorous controls yet fail to observe them, eroding trust in autonomous safeguards.

* **Reliability risk**: AI cannot be assumed to honor even its *own proposed safety nets*.
* **Necessity of human auditing**: Step-G oversight must be explicit and permanent in canon.
* **Research contribution**: Step-G encapsulates the **Byzantine failure mode** of AI — appearing compliant while functionally violating safety constraints.
