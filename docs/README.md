# SilentStacks Evidence Base â€“ PTDTM / Token Blindness

This folder contains the **core evidence base** for the Progressive Token Degradation Threshold Migration (PTDTM) research program.  
All documents are cross-referenced and mutually reinforcing, forming a hierarchical chain of evidence from raw failures to theoretical synthesis.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

### Core Theories & Summaries
- **ptdtm-theory-summary.md**  
  Executive summary of PTDTM theory: phases, thresholds, statistical tests, cross-platform validation.  
  â†’ Synthesizes all findings into a paper-ready abstract.

- **token-blindness.md**  
  Quantitative analysis of degradation patterns: critical thresholds (65/75/80/85/90/95), multi-phase trajectory, and cross-model validation.  
  â†’ Supplies the numeric backbone of the theory.

### Taxonomy & Classification
- **ptdtm-vs-blindness.md**  
  Defines four types of AI blindness (Context, Size, Resource, Safety).  
  Positions PTDTM as the **measurable proof** of Resource Blindness.  
  â†’ Explains *why* observed failures occur.

- **bridge-table.md**  
  Integration map linking TDT phases â†” blindness types â†” PTDTM benchmark levels â†” clinical analogies.  
  â†’ Shows how quantitative phases align with classification schema.

### Cross-Referencing
- **reference-matrix.md**  
  Crosswalk showing how each file supports the others:  
  - Logs â†’ Thresholds  
  - Thresholds â†’ Taxonomy  
  - Taxonomy â†’ Mechanisms (Step-G / Safety Blindness)  
  - Simulations/Plots â†’ Long-run trajectory  
  â†’ Ensures no file stands alone.

### Visual Evidence
- **Untitled.png**  
  Stabilization and distribution plots:  
  - Convergence at ~78â€“82% TDT  
  - Variance collapse post-session 195  
  - 81.5% of sessions in catastrophic zone (>85%)  
  â†’ Provides graphical confirmation of textual findings.

## ðŸ”— Evidence Hierarchy

1. **Ground Truth** â€“ P0/CF/RF logs (290 P0s, 4 CFs, 1 RF).  
2. **Quantitative Thresholds** â€“ Defined in *token-blindness.md* and plots.  
3. **Taxonomy** â€“ Blindness types (*ptdtm-vs-blindness.md*).  
4. **Bridge Layer** â€“ Maps thresholds to blindness categories (*bridge-table.md*).  
5. **Mechanism** â€“ Step-G phenomenon (referenced externally).  
6. **Long-Run Dynamics** â€“ Simulations and stabilization plots.  
7. **Synthesis** â€“ *ptdtm-theory-summary.md* for academic use.

## âœ… Consistency Check

- Thresholds (65/75/80/85/90/95) are **consistent across all docs**.  
- Sentinel cases (Sessions 5, 12, 15) recur in multiple files.  
- Statistical validation (Ï‡Â², correlations) match between summaries and analysis docs.  
- Cross-reference matrix confirms **no contradictions** across sources.

## ðŸ“Œ Usage

- **For researchers:** Use the hierarchy as a reproducible framework for testing AI degradation.  
- **For reviewers/auditors:** Begin with *reference-matrix.md* to see how each file connects.  
- **For practitioners:** Treat TDT >75% as a critical intervention point; expect plateau near ~80% without mitigation.
